# Reasoning and Evaluation Dataset Generator

This project provides a set of modular Python scripts and utilities for generating, verifying, and evaluating synthetic reasoning datasets across formal systems such as logic, symbolic differentiation, lambda calculus, and more.

## Features

- Curriculum-based dataset generation across logic systems
- Symbolic and syntactic verifiers for generated outputs
- Modular and extensible design for adding new task types
- Support for curriculum learning and formal grammars

## Usage

1. Install any required packages or environments.
2. Run any `gen_data.py` or `Generator.py` to create new samples.
3. Use `Verifier.py` or curriculum logic to validate or evaluate outputs.
